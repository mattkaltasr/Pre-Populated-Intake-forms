# Pre-populated Intake Forms

[![Build Status](https://drone.hdap.gatech.edu/api/badges/gt-cs6440-hit-fall2020/Pre-Populated-Intake-Forms/status.svg?ref=refs/heads/stable)](https://drone.hdap.gatech.edu/gt-cs6440-hit-fall2020/Pre-Populated-Intake-Forms)

Intake forms are almost always filled out manually by patients even when the information required 
is readily available in individual health records. This is both cumbersome for patients and increases 
the chances of inaccuracy in reporting, particularly around existing conditions and medications. 

The project team should build an intake form application that pulls from patient records 
(represented as **[FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/)**) and pre-populates all relevant data common to intake forms, 
from the perspective of a patient logging into a tele-health service.
